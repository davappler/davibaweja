Hi there, I am Davinder Singh working as a software engineer. I am a full time developer and a part time musician, I like to take some time away from coding and explore nature and music. I look forward to gain more skills in my day to day life, coding life has been an amazing journey which has helped me to find myself in a place where I can put my knowledge into real world problems.
